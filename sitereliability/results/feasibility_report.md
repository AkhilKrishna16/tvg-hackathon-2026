## #1 — East Austin Industrial Corridor (ID 1)

**Verdict:** HIGH  
**Composite Score:** 0.8875  
**Coordinates:** 30.2672, -97.7431

| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Load Relief | 0.92 |
| Loss Reduction | 0.88 |
| Sustainability | 0.74 |
| Redundancy | 0.81 |

**Land Use:** East Austin industrial corridor near the intersection of Airport Boulevard and the former industrial zones along Bolm Road and Springdale Road. This area historically contains light manufacturing facilities, warehouses, auto-related businesses, and transitional industrial parcels. The coordinates place this site near the MLK/183 corridor, an area that has seen mixed redevelopment pressure but retains significant industrial land use. Some parcels may include rail-adjacent storage or logistics operations.  
**Zoning:** Primarily Industrial (LI - Limited Industrial or GR - Community Commercial with industrial overlay in Austin zoning framework). Utility infrastructure use is generally feasible under Austin's industrial zoning classifications, which typically permit electrical substations as a permitted or conditional use. The area's industrial designation reduces permitting friction compared to residential or mixed-use zones.  
**Environmental Flags:** Proximity to Boggy Creek watershed — portions of East Austin near this corridor fall within FEMA-mapped 100-year or 500-year floodplain zones requiring detailed hydrological review, Historic industrial land use raises potential brownfield and soil contamination concerns requiring Phase I/II environmental site assessment, Impervious cover and stormwater runoff constraints under Austin's Watershed Ordinance, Possible proximity to critical water quality zones depending on exact parcel boundaries  
**Community Sensitivity:** medium — The area is industrial in character which reduces direct residential impact, but East Austin has experienced significant gentrification pressure with new residential and mixed-use development encroaching on formerly industrial blocks. Environmental justice considerations are relevant given the historically underserved demographics of East Austin. No major hospitals or schools appear to be immediately adjacent at these coordinates, but community stakeholder engagement would be advisable.  
**Grid Proximity:** This location is well-positioned relative to Austin Energy's existing transmission infrastructure. The East Austin area is served by transmission lines running along the US-183 corridor and existing distribution substations in the broader East Austin service territory. The industrial corridor likely has existing 69kV or 138kV transmission access within 1-3 miles, and proximity to the Austin Energy grid backbone makes interconnection costs moderate to favorable. Railroad rights-of-way in the area may also coincide with utility easements.

**Reasoning:** The East Austin Industrial Corridor at these coordinates presents a strong candidate for substation siting based on converging favorable factors: industrial zoning that accommodates utility infrastructure with manageable permitting risk, high optimization scores across all four metrics including exceptional load relief (0.92) and loss reduction (0.88) reflecting genuine grid need in this growing corridor, and reasonable proximity to existing Austin Energy transmission assets. The primary risks are manageable — Boggy Creek floodplain exposure requires engineering mitigation and elevation design, brownfield contamination screening is standard due diligence, and community sensitivity is moderate rather than high given the industrial context. The composite score of 0.8875 is well-supported by the site characteristics. Recommended next steps include confirming parcel availability, ordering a flood elevation certificate, initiating Phase I ESA, and engaging Austin Energy's transmission planning team to confirm interconnection feasibility at 138kV.

## #2 — Pflugerville / Wells Branch (ID 4)

**Verdict:** HIGH  
**Composite Score:** 0.79  
**Coordinates:** 30.3882, -97.7249

| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Load Relief | 0.79 |
| Loss Reduction | 0.77 |
| Sustainability | 0.85 |
| Redundancy | 0.66 |

**Land Use:** This location sits in the Pflugerville/Wells Branch corridor near the intersection of major arterials including Wells Branch Parkway and I-35 frontage areas. The area is characterized by a mix of light industrial parks, big-box retail, logistics/warehouse facilities, and suburban commercial development. Wells Branch is a master-planned community with significant commercial activity along its southern and western edges. There are established business parks and some older suburban residential neighborhoods within 0.5-1 mile radius.  
**Zoning:** Mixed commercial and light industrial — utility infrastructure use is generally feasible. This corridor in Pflugerville and unincorporated Travis County/Williamson County fringe areas typically has C-2/C-3 commercial or LI (light industrial) zoning designations, both of which commonly permit utility substations as a conditional or by-right use. The presence of existing industrial and logistics users reduces political friction for substation siting compared to purely residential zones.  
**Environmental Flags:** Wells Branch Creek and its tributaries run through this general area and have documented FEMA 100-year floodplain zones that must be assessed for site-specific parcels, Portions of Wells Branch corridor contain wetland-adjacent riparian buffers requiring Army Corps Section 404 review, Expansive clay soils common in this part of Central Texas may require significant geotechnical foundation engineering, Moderate impervious cover restrictions may apply under City of Pflugerville or Travis County stormwater regulations  
**Community Sensitivity:** medium — The area contains residential neighborhoods (Wells Branch subdivision) within 0.5 to 1 mile, and several elementary schools and community parks are located within the broader Wells Branch community. However, the immediate commercial/industrial buffer between likely substation parcels and residential areas reduces direct impact. Community opposition is possible but not likely to be severe given existing industrial land uses nearby.  
**Grid Proximity:** This location is well-positioned relative to existing transmission infrastructure. The I-35 corridor through this area hosts multiple overhead transmission lines running north-south connecting Austin Energy and ERCOT facilities between Austin and Round Rock/Georgetown. Oncor and Austin Energy both have distribution infrastructure in this corridor. A new substation here would likely tap into 138kV or 69kV transmission lines already present along the I-35 right-of-way, minimizing new transmission build requirements.

**Reasoning:** The Pflugerville/Wells Branch location at 30.3882, -97.7249 presents a strong substation siting opportunity with a well-justified composite score of 0.79. The area's mix of light industrial and commercial zoning provides a permissive regulatory environment for utility infrastructure, and proximity to existing I-35 corridor transmission lines substantially reduces interconnection costs and construction complexity. The high sustainability score (0.85) likely reflects the opportunity to serve a rapidly growing suburban load pocket in North Austin/Pflugerville, which has seen significant residential and commercial growth creating real load relief value (0.79). The primary concerns are floodplain avoidance given Wells Branch Creek hydrology, moderate community sensitivity due to nearby residential areas, and the relatively lower redundancy score (0.66) suggesting this node may need future network reinforcement. Overall, this site is technically sound, commercially viable, and environmentally manageable with standard due diligence, making it a high-feasibility candidate subject to parcel-level flood zone and title review.

## #3 — Southeast Austin / Del Valle (ID 5)

**Verdict:** HIGH  
**Composite Score:** 0.7875  
**Coordinates:** 30.25, -97.67

| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Load Relief | 0.76 |
| Loss Reduction | 0.82 |
| Sustainability | 0.88 |
| Redundancy | 0.63 |

**Land Use:** This area in Southeast Austin / Del Valle sits near the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport corridor and includes a mix of light industrial, warehouse/logistics, and undeveloped rural land. The coordinates place this site roughly between the airport's southeastern perimeter and the Colorado River / Bastrop Highway (TX-71) corridor. The area has seen significant industrial and distribution center growth due to its proximity to the airport and major freight routes, including facilities associated with e-commerce and manufacturing. Some agricultural and undeveloped tracts remain, making land acquisition plausible.  
**Zoning:** Primarily industrial and limited-purpose zoning with some mixed-use transitional zones near TX-71. Travis County and City of Austin jurisdictions overlap here, with portions under less restrictive county zoning. Utility infrastructure use is generally feasible in this zone type; electrical substations are typically permitted as a compatible industrial/utility land use, and the lower density of sensitive uses reduces permitting friction.  
**Environmental Flags:** Proximity to the Colorado River floodplain and associated FEMA-designated flood zones, particularly near Onion Creek and Colorado River tributaries, Portions of this area fall within the 100-year floodplain, which may require elevated construction or flood mitigation design, Potential wetlands associated with riparian corridors near the Colorado River, Regional stormwater drainage concerns given flat to gently rolling terrain with limited natural drainage relief, Possible migratory bird corridors due to proximity to airport open land and river greenbelts  
**Community Sensitivity:** medium — The area is primarily industrial and semi-rural with limited dense residential development immediately at these coordinates. However, the Del Valle community, including Del Valle Independent School District facilities and lower-income residential neighborhoods, lies within 2-4 miles to the southeast. Environmental justice considerations apply given the historically underserved nature of the Del Valle community, which has disproportionately hosted industrial uses. Proximity to the airport also introduces coordination requirements with FAA regarding structure height.  
**Grid Proximity:** This location is well-positioned relative to existing transmission infrastructure. Austin Energy operates 138kV and 345kV transmission lines running through the Southeast Austin corridor connecting to the Southeastern and Govalle substations. ERCOT transmission assets serving the airport and industrial load corridor pass through this area. The site is likely within 1-3 miles of existing high-voltage transmission lines along TX-71 and FM 812, reducing the cost and complexity of transmission interconnection.

**Reasoning:** The Southeast Austin / Del Valle site presents strong overall feasibility for substation development. The composite optimization score of 0.7875 is supported by high sustainability and loss reduction scores, reflecting this area's role as a growing load center driven by airport logistics, data center expansion along TX-71, and residential growth pressure in eastern Travis County. The industrial and semi-rural land use mix makes utility siting politically and logistically tractable, and proximity to existing 138kV and 345kV ERCOT/Austin Energy transmission corridors reduces interconnection costs. The primary risks are floodplain constraints requiring careful site micro-selection and geotechnical assessment, along with environmental justice due diligence given the Del Valle community context. The relatively lower redundancy score (0.63) suggests that transmission feed diversity should be a design priority. With proper site screening to avoid mapped flood zones, FAA height coordination, and community engagement with Del Valle stakeholders, this location is a strong candidate for near-term substation development.

## #4 — North Lamar / Rundberg Area (ID 2)

**Verdict:** MEDIUM  
**Composite Score:** 0.8225  
**Coordinates:** 30.3074, -97.7536

| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Load Relief | 0.85 |
| Loss Reduction | 0.79 |
| Sustainability | 0.68 |
| Redundancy | 0.77 |

**Land Use:** The coordinates 30.3074, -97.7536 place this site in the North Lamar Boulevard and Rundberg Lane corridor in North Austin. This area is characterized by a dense mix of strip commercial retail, aging multi-family apartment complexes, budget motels, and light commercial businesses. Rundberg Lane is historically known as a high-density, lower-income corridor with numerous apartment communities housing a large immigrant and working-class population. The immediate vicinity likely contains commercial strip centers, parking lots, and surface-level retail that could theoretically host utility infrastructure, but land parcels tend to be small and fragmented.  
**Zoning:** Mixed commercial and multi-family residential (CS - General Commercial Services and MF-3/MF-4 zoning categories under Austin's Land Development Code). Utility infrastructure use is conditionally feasible in CS-zoned parcels but would face significant challenges given parcel fragmentation, existing lease obligations, and the density of surrounding residential use. A dedicated utility easement or City-owned parcel would be required. Rezoning to Public (P) or utility overlay would likely be necessary.  
**Environmental Flags:** Portions of the Rundberg area near North Lamar have low-lying drainage corridors associated with Walnut Creek and tributary systems — FEMA floodplain Zone AE risk possible within several hundred meters, Proximity to Buttermilk Creek watershed may trigger City of Austin Environmental Criteria Manual review, Urban heat island concentration in this dense commercial corridor may affect equipment thermal ratings, Potential soil contamination from legacy auto-repair shops and light industrial uses common in this corridor (Phase I ESA would be required)  
**Community Sensitivity:** high — Rundberg Lane is one of Austin's most densely populated low-income corridors with a high concentration of apartment residents, several nearby schools including AISD campuses within 0.5–1 mile radius, and community advocacy groups historically sensitive to industrial siting decisions perceived as environmental justice concerns. The area has been subject to equity-focused city planning initiatives, meaning any substation proposal would face heightened public scrutiny and likely organized community opposition.  
**Grid Proximity:** Austin Energy operates significant transmission infrastructure along the North Lamar corridor. The Rundberg area is in proximity to Austin Energy's North Austin service district, with 138kV and 69kV transmission lines running along major arterials including Lamar Boulevard and Metric Boulevard approximately 0.5–1.5 miles to the east. The Northgate or North Austin substations serve as the nearest major grid nodes, suggesting this location could serve as an intermediate distribution substation to relieve radial feeder load in this underserved corridor — consistent with the high load_relief score of 0.85.

**Reasoning:** The North Lamar/Rundberg site scores well on technical metrics — particularly load relief (0.85) and redundancy (0.77) — reflecting genuine grid stress in this high-density, underserved corridor. However, real-world siting feasibility is constrained by several compounding factors: parcel fragmentation and mixed land use make land acquisition difficult and expensive, environmental review will be triggered by proximity to Buttermilk Creek drainage infrastructure, and the community sensitivity is high given the area's status as a low-income, majority-minority neighborhood with active advocacy networks that will likely frame a substation as an environmental justice concern. The sustainability score of 0.68 is the weakest metric and may reflect these site constraints. Feasibility is rated MEDIUM — the grid need is real and the technical case is strong, but success depends on Austin Energy identifying a City-owned or willing-seller commercial parcel, conducting early community engagement, commissioning environmental and geotechnical studies promptly, and potentially pairing the project with community benefit agreements to address equity concerns.

## #5 — South Austin / Slaughter Lane Corridor (ID 3)

**Verdict:** MEDIUM  
**Composite Score:** 0.8075  
**Coordinates:** 30.224, -97.801

| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Load Relief | 0.83 |
| Loss Reduction | 0.81 |
| Sustainability | 0.72 |
| Redundancy | 0.7 |

**Land Use:** The coordinates 30.224, -97.801 place this site in the South Austin area near the Slaughter Lane corridor, approximately at the intersection of Slaughter Lane and Manchaca Road or nearby. This area is characterized by a mix of retail strip centers, big-box commercial development, apartment complexes, and suburban residential neighborhoods. The Slaughter Lane corridor has seen significant commercial buildout over the past two decades. There may be vacant or underutilized commercial parcels, surface parking lots, or light industrial/flex space properties in this vicinity that could be considered for acquisition.  
**Zoning:** Mixed commercial and residential zoning is predominant in this corridor. Austin zoning likely reflects GR (Community Commercial), LR (Neighborhood Commercial), or SF-3/SF-6 residential designations depending on exact parcel. Utility infrastructure use (electrical substation) is generally feasible under commercial or industrial zoning with a conditional use permit or utility overlay, but proximity to residential zones would require careful setback planning and screening. Austin Energy has precedent for siting substations in commercially zoned areas with proper buffering.  
**Environmental Flags:** Proximity to Williamson Creek and its tributaries, which run through South Austin and carry FEMA-designated 100-year floodplain designations in several segments near this corridor, Potential impervious cover restrictions under Austin's Save Our Springs (SOS) Ordinance if site is within the Barton Springs contributing or recharge zone — coordinates are near the edge of this sensitive area, Stormwater management requirements under Austin Watershed Protection regulations, Possible heritage tree protections under Austin's tree ordinance if mature oaks or other protected species are present on candidate parcel  
**Community Sensitivity:** medium — The Slaughter Lane corridor has residential neighborhoods (including apartment complexes and single-family subdivisions) within close proximity, and there are schools in the broader South Austin area. However, the commercial character of the corridor provides natural buffering. Community opposition to substation placement is possible but manageable with proper design, noise mitigation, and visual screening. This is not a highly affluent or politically organized neighborhood compared to central Austin, but environmental justice considerations for surrounding working-class and Latino communities should be addressed.  
**Grid Proximity:** This location is well-positioned relative to Austin Energy's existing transmission infrastructure. The Slaughter Lane corridor is served by existing 138kV and distribution-level lines running along major arterials in South Austin. Austin Energy's Slaughter Creek and South Austin substations are in the general vicinity, making this an area with established grid presence and realistic interconnection pathways. The site likely falls within a distribution zone experiencing load growth pressure from dense residential and commercial development, consistent with the high load_relief and loss_reduction scores.

**Reasoning:** The South Austin / Slaughter Lane corridor presents a moderately feasible substation site with strong electrical justification — the high composite score of 0.8075 reflects genuine load growth pressure from rapid residential and commercial expansion in this part of Austin. The area has existing grid infrastructure that would facilitate interconnection, and commercial land uses along Slaughter Lane offer viable acquisition targets. However, feasibility is tempered to MEDIUM due to three substantive concerns: first, the potential overlap with the Barton Springs Zone environmental sensitivity area could trigger SOS Ordinance review and significant regulatory hurdles; second, Williamson Creek floodplain constraints may limit usable acreage on certain parcels; and third, the dense mix of apartments and retail creates moderate community sensitivity requiring proactive engagement and design mitigation. Austin Energy should conduct a detailed parcel-level environmental and zoning review, prioritize sites on the north side of Slaughter Lane to maximize distance from creek corridors, and engage Austin's Development Services Department early to assess conditional use permitting pathways. If environmental clearance can be secured, this location offers meaningful grid benefits for an underserved growth area.

## #6 — Cedar Park / Leander Substation Zone (ID 6)

**Verdict:** MEDIUM  
**Composite Score:** 0.7475  
**Coordinates:** 30.35, -97.91

| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Load Relief | 0.74 |
| Loss Reduction | 0.71 |
| Sustainability | 0.82 |
| Redundancy | 0.72 |

**Land Use:** This area sits within the rapidly growing Cedar Park/Leander corridor in Williamson County, northwest Austin metro. The coordinates near 30.35, -97.91 fall in a zone that likely features a mix of newer suburban residential developments, commercial strip centers along major arterials (likely near US-183A toll road corridor or RM 620), and transitional land parcels. This part of Cedar Park/Leander has seen explosive residential and mixed-use development since 2015, with some remaining undeveloped or agricultural tracts that could serve as viable substation sites.  
**Zoning:** Mixed — predominantly suburban residential and commercial with some transitional/undeveloped parcels. Utility infrastructure use is conditionally feasible; Texas municipal utility districts (MUDs) and Pedernales Electric Cooperative or Austin Energy service territories overlap here, and utility easements are common. A substation would likely require a special use permit or specific utility zoning designation. Williamson County and City of Cedar Park both have utility accommodation provisions, but proximity to residential master-planned communities may complicate approvals.  
**Environmental Flags:** Brushy Creek and its tributaries run through this general corridor, creating potential 100-year floodplain encroachments that must be verified via FEMA FIRM maps, Edwards Aquifer Contributing Zone presence is possible in western portions, triggering additional TCEQ and city stormwater regulations, Karst topography risk in western Cedar Park/Leander — subsurface limestone features may complicate foundation engineering, Texas Hill Country transitional habitat — potential presence of Golden-cheeked Warbler or Black-capped Vireo habitat if mature juniper-oak woodland exists on parcel, Wildland-Urban Interface fire risk is moderate given cedar (Ashe juniper) encroachment in undeveloped tracts  
**Community Sensitivity:** high — Cedar Park and Leander are among the fastest-growing cities in the US, with dense suburban residential neighborhoods, multiple LISD and RRISD school campuses, and active HOA communities throughout this zone. Visual impact, EMF concerns, and traffic during construction are likely to generate public opposition. Community engagement and setback buffers will be essential.  
**Grid Proximity:** This zone is served by either Pedernales Electric Cooperative or Austin Energy depending on exact parcel location near the service territory boundary. The 183A/US-183 corridor has existing distribution infrastructure, and Oncor and AE transmission lines traverse the broader northwest Austin region. The LCRA transmission grid has 138kV lines running through Williamson County that could provide viable interconnection points within 2-5 miles. The proximity to the proposed and existing substations serving the 1890 Ranch and Leander urban core developments suggests existing medium-voltage distribution backbone.

**Reasoning:** The Cedar Park/Leander zone presents a genuinely compelling case for substation investment given its strong optimization scores — particularly the 0.82 sustainability score reflecting solar-ready grid modernization potential and the 0.74 load relief score reflecting surging residential demand in one of Texas's hottest growth corridors. However, feasibility is capped at MEDIUM due to the combination of high community sensitivity in a dense suburban environment, potential Edwards Aquifer and Brushy Creek floodplain constraints, and the likelihood that suitable undeveloped parcels large enough for a substation footprint (typically 2-5 acres minimum) are increasingly scarce and expensive in this market. Success depends heavily on identifying a commercially or industrially zoned parcel along a major arterial with adequate transmission line access, conducting early environmental screening for karst and floodplain issues, and initiating community stakeholder engagement before formal permitting. The 0.7475 composite score is credible and the load growth fundamentals are strong — this is a viable candidate requiring careful site-specific validation.

## #7 — Buda / Kyle Growth Corridor (ID 7)

**Verdict:** MEDIUM  
**Composite Score:** 0.735  
**Coordinates:** 30.18, -97.78

| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Load Relief | 0.71 |
| Loss Reduction | 0.75 |
| Sustainability | 0.83 |
| Redundancy | 0.65 |

**Land Use:** This corridor along the I-35 frontage between Buda and Kyle (Hays County) is characterized by a mix of rapidly developing commercial strips, light industrial parks, big-box retail, and newer residential subdivisions. The coordinates near 30.18, -97.78 fall in the southern Travis/northern Hays County transition zone, likely near FM 1626 or Turnersville Road areas, where undeveloped or semi-developed land parcels are still available amid accelerating suburban sprawl driven by Austin metro growth.  
**Zoning:** Mixed commercial and light industrial with pockets of medium-density residential. The Buda-Kyle corridor has actively courted industrial and logistics uses, making utility infrastructure generally feasible from a zoning standpoint. Both Buda and Kyle have ETJ (extraterritorial jurisdiction) zones where utility easements and industrial siting face lower opposition. Utility use is likely feasible pending specific parcel zoning confirmation, with commercial/industrial-zoned land offering the clearest path to permitting.  
**Environmental Flags:** Onion Creek and its tributaries run through portions of this corridor and carry significant FEMA 100-year floodplain designations — site-specific flood map review required, Blanco River watershed adjacency in southern portions may trigger Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone or Contributing Zone restrictions, Texas Hill Country transition soils may present karst limestone features requiring geotechnical assessment, Migratory bird corridors and golden-cheeked warbler habitat possible in vegetated upland areas west of I-35  
**Community Sensitivity:** medium — The corridor has substantial residential growth with new subdivisions (Bradfield Village, Plum Creek, etc.) in close proximity, raising visual and noise concerns. However, the industrial character of much of the I-35 frontage buffers the most sensitive receptors. Schools exist in Kyle and Buda proper but are likely more than 0.5 miles from optimal industrial parcels. Sensitivity is moderate and manageable with proper site selection within the corridor.  
**Grid Proximity:** This area is served by Pedernales Electric Cooperative (PEC) and Austin Energy at the boundary zone, with Oncor transmission assets also present near the Hays-Travis county line. LCRA operates 138kV and 345kV transmission lines running roughly parallel to I-35 in this corridor, making transmission interconnection feasible. The rapid load growth from residential and commercial development in Kyle and Buda has already prompted substation upgrades, meaning existing right-of-way corridors and interconnection points are likely identifiable within 1-3 miles.

**Reasoning:** The Buda/Kyle Growth Corridor is a high-growth area with genuine and urgent load relief needs, reflected in the strong optimization scores — particularly sustainability (0.83) and loss reduction (0.75), consistent with serving a sprawling new load center far from existing Austin substations. The I-35 corridor offers industrial-friendly zoning and proximity to LCRA transmission infrastructure, making interconnection viable. However, feasibility is tempered to MEDIUM due to three compounding risks: (1) Onion Creek floodplain constraints may eliminate otherwise attractive parcels, (2) the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone triggers TCEQ review and may impose stormwater and impervious cover limitations that complicate substation grading and oil containment design, and (3) the jurisdictional patchwork between Austin Energy, PEC, and Oncor service territories requires careful coordination to determine the responsible utility and avoid franchise conflicts. A targeted parcel search focusing on light industrial zones north of FM 2001 and east of I-35 would likely yield the highest-feasibility sites within this corridor, with detailed flood and aquifer mapping as the critical first due-diligence step.

## #8 — Manor / Tech Ridge East (ID 8)

**Verdict:** MEDIUM  
**Composite Score:** 0.72  
**Coordinates:** 30.42, -97.68

| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Load Relief | 0.68 |
| Loss Reduction | 0.73 |
| Sustainability | 0.79 |
| Redundancy | 0.68 |

**Land Use:** This area along the Tech Ridge corridor northeast of Austin near Manor Road and SH-130 is characterized by a mix of rapidly developing commercial and light industrial uses, with several business parks, distribution centers, and tech campuses. The broader Tech Ridge area includes retail nodes, office parks, and logistics facilities. At approximately 30.42, -97.68, the site likely sits within or adjacent to developing commercial/industrial land along the US-290 East or Manor Road corridor, potentially including undeveloped parcels or recently platted business park land typical of this fast-growing suburban fringe zone.  
**Zoning:** Primarily commercial and light industrial — City of Austin zoning in this corridor typically includes GR (Community Commercial), CS (General Commercial Services), and LI (Limited Industrial) designations, with some mixed-use overlay zones. Light industrial and commercial zoning in this corridor is generally feasible for utility infrastructure placement, and Austin Energy has precedent for siting substations within such zones. A utility easement or public utility district classification would likely be achievable with moderate permitting effort.  
**Environmental Flags:** Portions of the broader Manor Road and Walnut Creek watershed area contain FEMA-designated 100-year floodplain zones — site-specific FEMA FIRM panel review required, Walnut Creek and its tributaries run through this general area, creating potential riparian buffer and impervious cover restrictions under City of Austin Watershed Protection Ordinance, Austin's Critical Water Quality Zone (CWQZ) buffers may apply if site is near any creek segment, Expansive clay soils common in this region of Travis County may require geotechnical assessment for foundation design  
**Community Sensitivity:** medium — The Tech Ridge East area is proximate to growing residential subdivisions to the north and east in the Manor ISD zone, and several apartment complexes have been developed along the corridor in recent years. No major hospitals or schools appear to be immediately adjacent at these coordinates, but residential encroachment from the growing Manor and Northeast Austin communities warrants careful noise, aesthetics, and setback planning. Sensitivity is elevated relative to purely industrial sites but manageable with standard screening and buffer measures.  
**Grid Proximity:** This location is well-positioned relative to Austin Energy's northeast transmission infrastructure. The SH-130 toll corridor serves as a utility corridor with existing high-voltage transmission lines running north-south in the area. Austin Energy operates the Coronado Hills and surrounding substations in the northeast Austin grid zone, and ERCOT transmission assets serving the eastern Travis County load pocket are accessible. The Tech Ridge growth area has been a known load growth hotspot, suggesting Austin Energy has likely already evaluated transmission tie points in this vicinity.

**Reasoning:** The Manor / Tech Ridge East location presents a moderately strong case for substation siting driven by genuine load growth pressure from rapid commercial and residential development in Northeast Austin and the Manor corridor. The optimization scores reflect real infrastructure need — load relief and loss reduction scores are solid, and the sustainability score of 0.79 likely reflects proximity to solar-friendly open land and potential for modern grid-edge integration. The primary constraints are hydrological: the Walnut Creek watershed creates meaningful floodplain and water quality buffer risks that must be resolved through site-specific survey before commitment. Zoning compatibility is favorable given the commercial-industrial character of Tech Ridge, and community sensitivity is manageable but not negligible given residential growth pressure. Grid proximity to existing northeast Austin transmission assets is a genuine advantage. Overall feasibility is MEDIUM pending floodplain confirmation and a site-specific parcel assessment — if a flood-clear parcel is identified within this zone, feasibility could be upgraded to HIGH.

## #9 — West Austin / Bee Cave Road (ID 9)

**Verdict:** MEDIUM  
**Composite Score:** 0.685  
**Coordinates:** 30.29, -98.01

| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Load Relief | 0.66 |
| Loss Reduction | 0.69 |
| Sustainability | 0.64 |
| Redundancy | 0.75 |

**Land Use:** This coordinate places the site along the Bee Cave Road corridor (FM 2244) in the West Austin / Bee Cave area, near the boundary of Austin proper and the City of Bee Cave. The area features a mix of upscale retail centers (such as the Hill Country Galleria vicinity), office parks, residential subdivisions, and Hill Country terrain. At approximately 30.29, -98.01, the site is likely in a transitional zone between commercial strip development along Bee Cave Road and the surrounding residential and semi-rural Hill Country landscape.  
**Zoning:** Mixed commercial and low-density residential — utility infrastructure use is conditionally feasible but would require significant variance or special use permitting. The Bee Cave Road corridor is zoned for commercial and retail use in patches, but adjacent tracts shift quickly to residential or ETJ (extraterritorial jurisdiction) classifications under Austin or Bee Cave zoning. Utility/substation use typically requires either industrial or public utility zoning, which is uncommon in this affluent corridor without rezoning.  
**Environmental Flags:** Proximity to Barton Creek watershed and its tributaries, which fall under Austin's Critical Water Quality Zone (CWQZ) and Barton Springs Edwards Aquifer Contributing Zone regulations, Potential presence of karst geology and recharge features for the Edwards Aquifer, triggering strict impervious cover and runoff limitations, Possible FEMA-designated floodplain areas associated with Barton Creek or smaller tributary drainages, Hill Country terrain with slopes that may trigger cut/fill restrictions under Austin's Land Development Code, Potential habitat for protected species such as the golden-cheeked warbler or black-capped vireo in wooded Hill Country tracts  
**Community Sensitivity:** high — This corridor serves affluent West Austin and Bee Cave residential communities with strong organized civic voices. Proximity to high-end retail, upscale subdivisions, and recreational areas (Barton Creek Greenbelt access points nearby) means visible industrial infrastructure like a substation would face significant community opposition. Neighborhood associations in this area have historically been active in opposing incompatible land uses.  
**Grid Proximity:** Austin Energy operates transmission infrastructure serving West Austin, with 138kV and distribution lines running along major corridors including Bee Cave Road and Loop 360 (Capital of Texas Highway). The site is likely within a reasonable distance of existing Austin Energy distribution infrastructure, though proximity to high-voltage transmission tie-in points is less certain without detailed GIS data. The area's load growth from Bee Cave and Lakeway development makes it a logical service expansion zone, suggesting some existing grid assets are nearby.

**Reasoning:** The West Austin / Bee Cave Road candidate site scores reasonably well on optimization metrics — particularly redundancy (0.75) and loss reduction (0.69) — reflecting genuine load growth pressure in this rapidly developing corridor. However, real-world feasibility is constrained by several compounding factors. The Edwards Aquifer recharge zone and Barton Creek watershed protections impose some of the strictest environmental development standards in the Austin metro, potentially requiring costly mitigation or outright disqualifying certain parcels. Zoning compatibility is a significant hurdle, as the commercial and residential character of Bee Cave Road is inhospitable to utility infrastructure without rezoning. Community sensitivity is high given the affluent, organized constituency. That said, the load relief and redundancy scores suggest a real infrastructure need in this service territory, and Austin Energy has precedent for siting substations in challenging West Austin locations. A detailed site-specific survey focusing on parcels with existing commercial or utility zoning, located away from waterway buffers, could identify a workable footprint. Feasibility is rated MEDIUM — achievable with significant site selection refinement, environmental review, and community engagement, but not straightforward.

## #10 — Round Rock / Georgetown Border (ID 10)

**Verdict:** MEDIUM  
**Composite Score:** 0.6675  
**Coordinates:** 30.51, -97.82

| Score | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Load Relief | 0.63 |
| Loss Reduction | 0.66 |
| Sustainability | 0.77 |
| Redundancy | 0.61 |

**Land Use:** This coordinate sits near the Round Rock/Georgetown municipal border in Williamson County, Texas, roughly along the US-79 / TX-130 corridor. The area is characterized by a mix of rapidly developing suburban commercial strips, light industrial parks, and newer residential subdivisions. The TX-130 toll road corridor has attracted significant logistics, warehousing, and light manufacturing uses. There are also retail developments and master-planned communities in the immediate vicinity. Undeveloped or semi-developed tracts still exist in this transitional zone between the two fast-growing cities.  
**Zoning:** Mixed commercial and light industrial — utility infrastructure is feasible. Williamson County and the City of Round Rock both maintain utility/public facility zoning categories that accommodate electrical substations. The TX-130 corridor parcels are frequently zoned for heavy commercial or light industrial use, which typically permits utility installations with conditional use permits. However, proximity to newer residential developments may require setback negotiations and aesthetic screening requirements.  
**Environmental Flags:** Brushy Creek and its tributaries flow through this general region and have associated FEMA-mapped 100-year floodplains that must be avoided or mitigated, Black-capped Vireo and Golden-cheeked Warbler habitat has been documented in Williamson County — USFWS Section 7 consultation may be required if suitable habitat is present on the parcel, Expansive clay soils (Austin Chalk and Taylor Marl formations) common in this area present foundation engineering challenges for heavy substation equipment, Karst limestone features possible in northern portions of this zone, requiring geotechnical survey for sinkholes or caves  
**Community Sensitivity:** medium — The area is actively suburbanizing with new residential subdivisions and some schools serving the Round Rock ISD and Georgetown ISD. Visual and noise concerns from transformer equipment are a realistic community issue. However, the industrial and commercial character of the TX-130 corridor provides a natural buffer and precedent for utility-scale infrastructure. No major hospitals or dense urban neighborhoods are directly adjacent.  
**Grid Proximity:** This location is well-positioned relative to existing ERCOT transmission infrastructure. Oncor and PEC (Pedernales Electric Cooperative) service territories intersect near this zone. The TX-130 corridor has existing 138kV and 345kV transmission lines running roughly parallel to the toll road to serve the rapidly growing Williamson County load centers. The proximity to the Georgetown and Round Rock load pockets makes this a strategically logical interconnection point, and existing rights-of-way along TX-130 may facilitate transmission line access.

**Reasoning:** The Round Rock/Georgetown border location offers genuine strategic value given the explosive population and commercial growth in Williamson County, and the composite optimization score of 0.6675 reflects reasonable but not exceptional performance across metrics. The TX-130 corridor provides existing industrial land use context and likely transmission infrastructure access, making a substation politically and technically plausible. However, feasibility is held to MEDIUM rather than HIGH due to three compounding concerns: first, Brushy Creek floodplain mapping may constrain available parcels significantly; second, the rapid residential buildout in this area elevates community sensitivity and permitting complexity; and third, the relatively modest load relief and redundancy scores (0.63 and 0.61) suggest this location is not filling a critical gap in the existing network. The strong sustainability score (0.77) is a positive signal, possibly reflecting proximity to renewable interconnection opportunities or favorable grid modernization alignment. A detailed parcel-level floodplain analysis, geotechnical assessment, and transmission interconnection study should be completed before advancing this site.
